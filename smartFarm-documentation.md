## <span style="color:#2E7D32">Project Structure</span>

The SmartFarm project follows a client-server architecture, with a clear separation between the frontend (client) and backend (server) components.

### <span style="color:#1976D2">Client-Side Architecture</span>

The client-side of SmartFarm is built as a single-page application (SPA) using React. It follows a feature-based architecture, organizing code by domain functionality rather than technical concerns.

```

├── index.html               # Entry HTML file
└── vite.config.js           # Vite configuration
```

Key components of the client architecture:

1. **Feature Modules**: Self-contained modules that encapsulate related functionality, including components, hooks, and business logic.

2. **Pages**: Top-level components that represent different routes in the application.

3. **Routing**: Configuration for client-side routing using React Router.

4. **Services**: Modules that handle API communication with the backend.

5. **UI Components**: Reusable UI elements used across the application.

6. **Hooks**: Custom React hooks for shared stateful logic.

### <span style="color:#1976D2">Server-Side Architecture</span>

The server-side of SmartFarm is built with Node.js, following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern.
